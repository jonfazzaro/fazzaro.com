# Dead fish meeting conversations? Stop asking yes/no questions.

To break the habit, when a yes or no question comes to mind:

1. Assume the answer is yes.
2. Skip straight to the "what" or "how" version of your question.

Don't ask, "are there any questions?"
Ask, "what can I explain further?"

Don't ask, "does that make sense?"
Ask, "how does this relate to your ideas?"

Don't ask, "is there anything else?"
Ask, "what else?"

Unless you _actually_ want to end the conversation. Then use "is there anything else?"

(It'll always be a no.)

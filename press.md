## Giving an estimate? Be sure it has both parts.

First, a *quantity* (expressed as dollars, hours, etc.).
Second, a *probability* (expressed as a percentage).

Never give the first without the second.

As in: "There's a 75% probability that this will take 130 hours". Or, "we're 45% sure we'll have that done by tomorrow's
meeting".

Giving the quantity without the probability implies that the probability is ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. This is probably not
what you intend to communicate. (If it is, maybe take a seat.)

### What if they press you for the full 100 percent?

Sometimes people in power feel entitled to a guarantee. There are two reasonable responses:

1. **MATH**. Simply divide quantity by percentage. (And maybe multiply by 2 or 3 to account
   for [Hofstadter's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter's_law).)

2. **FAFO**. Simply complete the work being estimated. The fullness of time and good record keeping will render a
   perfect 100% estimate of how long it will have taken.

Both will lead to better conversations when it's time to predict the next batch of work.

### As ever, start small.

This is one of those things that is simple, but not easy. Ship in small batches so you get lots of practice.

# Embrace change! Then, get back to work.

I mean, when you guys are doing a thing in some code, you find other changes that you need to make.
Right? Not just me?

(Nope, not just me.)

So when I find work like that, my instinct is to plow straight ahead and do it. Might as well, while I'm in there. Plus, I might forget about it as soon as I look away.

Here's the thing, though: acting on that instinct *ruins everything*.

From the outside, "ruins everything" might look like:

+ regularly blown estimates
+ fraught and repetitive status conversations
+ "over-engineering"
+ "gold-plating"
+ "it takes as long as it takes"

And, of course, a loss of trust between everyone involved.

It's easy to see this found work as a failure of planning. And it's easy to respond to it by self-flagellating and swearing that we'll, like, *think harder* next time. Or just double the estimate again.

But, you guys: found work is *gold*.

Think about it. Here's this thing that eluded our best planning efforts, and we've just uncovered evidence that it's something we should at least consider doing. Surfacing it to the rest of the team in order to make that call together _may be the most valuable work we do_.

### When you find work, capture it, and don't do it yet.

That is to say:

> When you find work, capture it

Don't keep it in your head, in the air in conversation, or even jotted down in your favorite to-do app.

It's hidden work until someone puts it on the team's board.

> and DON'T do it (yet)

Once the work is captured, return your attention to the task you were doing when you discovered it.

### Get back to work.

If you fail to do this, and simply follow the rabbit down the hole instead, you will wreck your team's ability to deliver. Worse, you'll rob your sponsor of their ability to steer the product and spend its budget effectively.

Embrace change. Then, get back to work.

Or you'll ruin everything.

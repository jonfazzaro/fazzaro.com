<h2 id="toc_0">Giving an estimate? Be sure it has both parts.</h2>

<div class="entry-meta">
<a class="entry-date published">Mar 17, 2021</a>
</div>

<p>First, a <em>quantity</em> (expressed as dollars, hours, etc.).
Second, a <em>probability</em> (expressed as a percentage).</p>

<p>Never give the first without the second.</p>

<p>As in: &quot;There&#39;s a 75% probability that this will take 130 hours&quot;. Or, &quot;we&#39;re 45% sure we&#39;ll have that done by tomorrow&#39;s
meeting&quot;.</p>

<p>Giving the quantity without the probability implies that the probability is ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. This is probably not
what you intend to communicate. (If it is, maybe take a seat.)</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">What if they press you for the full 100 percent?</h3>

<p>Sometimes people in power feel entitled to a guarantee. There are two reasonable responses:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>MATH</strong>. Simply divide quantity by percentage. (And maybe multiply by 2 or 3 to account
for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter&#x27;s_law">Hofstadter&#39;s Law</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>FAFO</strong>. Simply complete the work being estimated. The fullness of time and good record keeping will render a
perfect 100% estimate of how long it will have taken.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Both will lead to better conversations when it&#39;s time to predict the next batch of work.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">As ever, start small.</h3>

<p>This is one of those things that is simple, but not easy. Ship in small batches so you get lots of practice.</p>
